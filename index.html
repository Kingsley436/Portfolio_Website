                Coding doesn’t require as many software tools since its just an act of code translation to machine readable form. Just a simple text editor like wordpad or notepad will suffice. As a coder you need to know the details of the syntax of your programming language. Programming requires that you perform document reviews and analysis along with coding that requires extra tools. These tools include code analysis tools, code generators, databases, testing frameworks, compilers, GUI designers, assemblers, debuggers, and modeling algorithms. A programmer needs lots of experince in order to obtain these skills. They should also be able to understand and create complex data structures.
